**Project Description: Mobile Web App for AC Remote Control**

Create a mobile web application that allows users to remotely control an air conditioner (AC) using a Jetson board. The web app will provide a user-friendly interface for sending AC control commands, and the backend will interact with an AC IR controller object that communicates with the Jetson's IO pins to control the AC.

**Features:**

1. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Design a mobile-friendly web page with intuitive UI elements for controlling AC settings such as power, temperature, and mode.
   - Implement buttons, sliders, and forms to enable user interaction.

2. **AC Control Commands:**
   - Provide options to turn the AC on/off, set the desired temperature, and select the operating mode (cool, heat, etc.).

3. **Backend Interaction:**
   - Develop a backend API that accepts POST requests from the mobile web app.
   - Parse JSON payloads from the requests to extract AC control commands.

4. **AC IR Controller:**
   - Implement an AC IR controller object that interprets AC control commands and generates corresponding IR signals.
   - Utilize the Jetson board's IO pins to send IR signals to the AC.

5. **Communication:**
   - Set up communication between the backend and the AC IR controller object to transmit AC control commands.

6. **Real-time Feedback:**
   - Provide real-time feedback to the user when AC control commands are sent successfully or encounter errors.

7. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the backend on a machine within the same local network as the Jetson board.
   - Access the mobile web app from any device connected to the local network.

**Steps:**

1. **Learning Phase:**
   - Familiarize yourself with Go programming language and web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
   - Explore the basics of working with Jetson board's IO pins for GPIO control.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - Set up your development environment by installing Go and choosing a code editor or IDE.
   - Create a new project directory and initialize a Go module.

3. **Web Interface Development:**
   - Design the mobile-friendly web page using HTML and CSS.
   - Implement interactive elements like buttons and sliders for AC control.

4. **Backend Implementation:**
   - Create a backend API using Go's `"net/http"` package.
   - Set up routes to handle incoming requests from the mobile web app.

5. **AC IR Controller Integration:**
   - Develop the AC IR controller object that can generate IR signals for different AC control commands.
   - Interface the AC IR controller with the backend API to trigger AC commands.

6. **Mobile Web App Interaction:**
   - Write JavaScript code in the mobile web page to capture user interactions.
   - Use Fetch API to send POST requests to the backend API with AC control commands.

7. **Testing and Refinement:**
   - Test the end-to-end functionality by accessing the mobile web app and observing AC responses.
   - Debug and refine your code, handling errors and edge cases.

8. **Deployment and Documentation:**
   - Deploy the backend on a local machine within the same network as the Jetson board.
   - Document the setup instructions, including how to access the mobile web app.

**Outcome:**

By completing this project, you'll have a functional mobile web app that serves as a remote control for your air conditioner. The backend will effectively communicate with the AC IR controller, allowing you to control the AC using your smartphone or any device connected to the local network. Additionally, you'll gain valuable experience in Go programming, web development, and IoT applications.
